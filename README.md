# obsidian-zola-minimal

A free (means better) alternative to Obsidian Publish. This repo contains an easy-to-use (read: simplistic) solution for converting an Obsidian Personal Knowledge Management System (read: bunch of random Markdowns) into a Zola site.

What's in this fork?
- Removed any mention of netlify.
- Configuration is done with enviromental variables.
- Uploaded to repo binaries are deleted, system ones are used.
- Removed any possibility to interact with website other than reading and traversing.

Credits:
* This repo was forked from [obsidian-zola-plus](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/obsidian-zola-plus).
* Wikilink parsing is powered by [obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export).

# Setup

- Setup environment variables as explained in `env.sh.sample`
  ```sh
  cp ./env.sh{.sample,}
  . ./env.sh
  ```

  ```
  $ python --version
  Python 3.12.2
  ```

# Gotchas
1. Do not have files with name `index.md` or `_index.md`
2. ~~Do not have files that have the same name as its subfolder (e.g. having both `.../category1.md` and `.../category1/xxx.md` is not allowed)~~ (Fixed)
3. `LANDING_PAGE` needs to be set to the slugified file name if `SLUGIFY` is turned on (e.g. to use `I am Home.md`, `LANDING_PAGE` needs to be `i-am-home`)
